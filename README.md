# ARCHIVED!!!

This repo is kept around for historical and "redirecting people" purposes. **The actual bot isn't going down,** instead all development work will be done at https://github.com/AtoraSuunva/smolbot. Smol Bot is a "private util bot" that turned spiritual successor to RobotOtter, and is now replacing RobotOtter's ancient (and now-broken) codebase. RobotOtter will remain public and freely available, but run off Smol Bot's codebase instead. Redirect all your issues/complaints/requests/etc to that repo instead.

# RobotOtter
Discord bot for stuff like flipping dice & rollig coins.

Now being repurposed to be more "moderation-focused," a m*otter*ator bot if you will.

# Preview

Test it on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/0w6AYrrMIUfO71oV)!

# How to use

## Invite it

0. Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=189078347207278593&scope=bot&permissions=0).
1. Select a server.
2. Authorize.

## Selfhosting

You can selfhost if you don't trust me for some reason :(
Do note that maybe I've overlooked something and it'll break when you eun it on your machine, but I try to make it easy to setup (for my sanity)

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't already
* Download/Pull RobotOtter from git
* Fill out `config_example.json`, then rename to `config.json` (Don't worry about owner, it gets filled out automatically)
* Open the directory it's in in the command line (NOT the node.js command prompt!! Window's cmd/powershell or Linux/OSX terminal!)
* Run `npm install`
* Run `node modules.js`

As an owner you get access to a few extra commands under `modules\core`, for managing the bot.

# Commands

I'll rewrite this later, maybe instead use the github wiki.

In the meantime, use `r?help`
